I have created an Employee Management System in python that will store the information in MySQL database.
This contains following operations:
1.Add Employee -> this will insert new row in our database.
2.Remove Employee -> will delete the record of an existing employee.
3.Promote Employee -> we can see all the changes made in our database.
4.Display Employee -> we have all the information about all the existing employees.
